> **Abstract:** We present a semantic search engine for translations of Cuneiform documents. The motivation for this work is to make the contant of the documents more accessible for reseachers outside the domain of Ancient Assyriology. We use state-of-the-art lexical-semantic methods to process a collection of Hittite documents. A smale-scale user survey proves the usefullness and inituitive usage of the resulting web-based search engine.

A demo of the tool is available [here](http://semsearch.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de).

This work has been carried in collabroation with the Department for [Ancient Philology](http://www.ao.altertumswissenschaften.uni-mainz.de) at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz.
